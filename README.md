# CSS Kitten Wheelbarrow

## Learning Goals

- Position elements absolutely

## Introduction

Oh no! All of our kittens have escaped from the wheelbarrow and we need to get
them back in. Help collect all the kittens and put them into the wheelbarrow
using CSS selectors and absolute positioning. 

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its directory
in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio Code. Finally,
run `bundle` to install the lab's dependencies.

## Position Elements Absolutely

There are a few different ways we can use CSS to position elements in our web
pages. _Absolute_ positioning means placing the element in its containing
element in a certain location that will stay the same no matter where other
elements are placed.

To get started with this lab, open index.html in the browser. Use the comments
in **css/place-kitty.css** to write the correct selectors to
move each kitty into the wheelbarrow.

## Saving Your Work Remotely

Currently, the work you've done on this assignmnent is only on your local
machine. To preserve work on your GitHub fork, you will need to stage the
changes you've made, commit them, and push the commit up to GitHub. Use
the following commands to do this:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Completed assignment"
git push
```

If you visit your fork on GitHub, you should now see that _you've_ made the most
recent commit, and your solution will be present in the files.

## Conclusion

Sometimes it takes a little bit of time to get used to how absolute positioning
works, so don't worry if you have to practice. It will help you create more
complex CSS layouts in the future.
